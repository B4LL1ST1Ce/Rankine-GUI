A GUI based rankine cycle calculator, capable of solving values for both a regular and reheat cycle and allows for value aquisition for specific states by making use of the CoolProp library. 

Output Values:
H - Specific Enthalpy (kJ/kg)
S - Specific Entropy (kJ/kgK)
P - Pressure (Pa)
T - Temperature (K)
Q - Dryness Quality
D - Density (kg/mÂ³)

*Both rankine_gui_v2.py and state_class.py are needed to work.
